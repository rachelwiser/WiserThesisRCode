#### Create a working directory. These files will then be saved in that directory. The RMDFiles file should be saved in this working directory too.

#### This should only be run once. Any subsequent analysis will use these already created files.

##### The Qualtrics data you start with should be saved in the Data/QualtricsDownloads after these files are created.

``` {r} 
dir.create("../Outputs")
dir.create("../Data")
dir.create("../Data/QualtricsDownloads")
dir.create("../Data/InitialProcessedData")
dir.create("../Data/ReadyForAnalysis")

```
